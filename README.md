# team-stable-marriage
a stable marriage calculator for team matching (as opposed to individual matching)

used for Venture Strategy Solutions; you have to do separate runs for returning consultants and new consultants

this sample code is for when there were
- 4 teams (2 looking for 4 consultants; 2 looking for 5 consultants)
- 8 returning consultants
- 10 new consultants

TODO: make a webpage for it
